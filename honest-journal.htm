    Firstly lets be fair, except for the very few. No ordinary person ever truly stays committed to an singular thing.
    <br>Now why is this relevant in this semi-hidden page? It is because this project depending on when this is seen by thee has been worked on from the inital stages an very short period of time compared to the project's existence.
    <br>Just the "index.html" for this project at this current point (December 2nd for those non-freedom loving folk 🦅🇺🇸) has about only maybe 3/4 hours of actual work in it.
    <br>What I be getting at if you can not comprehend the context by now is that I have been extremely procrastic, and have not worked that much on this. Is that bad? Perhaps but it simply is the truth.
    <br>And truth hurts for many to admit, because they are too afraid to face their own flaws.
    <br>Anyways this short burst of random rant concludes. This may or may not be the original words I had typed..
